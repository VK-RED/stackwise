Certainly! However, I need more information about the current state of the file and what specific changes you're looking to implement to make it look more sleek. Without knowing the current content of the file or the desired changes, I can't provide you with a rewritten version.

Could you please provide the existing TypeScript code from the file you're referring to, along with details on what aspects you'd like to improve or change? This will help me understand your requirements and provide you with a revised, sleeker version of the code.
