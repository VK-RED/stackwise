PLEASE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FOLLOWING CODE before answering the question:
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: apiKey,
  dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true
});

async function main() {
  const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],
    model: 'gpt-4-1106-preview',
  });
}

main();
